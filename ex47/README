Directions for using setup.py:
1. Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.
2. Rename (move) the NAME directory to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module.
3. Edityoursetup.py to have all the information for your project.
4. Renametests/NAME_tests.py to also have your module name.
5. Double check it’s all working by using nosetests again.
6. Start coding.
